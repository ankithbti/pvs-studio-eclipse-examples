# pvs-studio-eclipse-examples
This repository contains examples of integrating the analysis with PVS-Studio into Eclipse CDT and displaying the analyzer messages as warnings in IDE output window.

You can use PVS-Studio compiler monitoring (pvs-studio-analzyer) to trace compiler invocations from Eclipse CDT and run PVS-Studio analysis without modifying your build system. PVS-Studio log conversion tool (plog-converter) can be used to convert analyzer report to errorfile format, that is supported by Eclipse - this way analyzer messages can be displayed as warnings in the 'Problems' Eclipse output window.
